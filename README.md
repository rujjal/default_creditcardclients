#Introduction

The aim of this study is to exploit some supervised machine learning algorithms using Spark to identify the key drivers that determine the likelihood of credit card default, underlining the mathematical aspects behind the methods used. Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants. At the same time, most cardholders, irrespective of their repayment ability, the overused credit card for consumption and accumulated heavy credit and debts.

The objective is to construct an automated model capable of both identifying crucial factors and predicting credit card defaults based on client information and historical transactions. The study provides a comprehensive overview of supervised machine learning principles, accompanied by an in-depth explanation of the techniques and algorithms employed in model development. Specifically, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms have been utilized.
